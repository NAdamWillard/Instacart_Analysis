## Objective

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.  The goal of this project was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Contents

- The final report with all of the comprehensive information, including visualizations, transformations to the data, and final analysis, can be found in the "Sent to Client" folder.  
- The scripts used to produce all of this can be found in the "Scripts" folder.  
- All of the visualizations used in the report (and some which didn't make it into the final report) can be found in the "Visualizations" folder.

## Data

The dataset for this project was comprised of information about:
+ orders
+ products and their departments
+ customer information and demographics (fabricated for the project)

## Tools

For this project, the following tools and libraries were used:

* Python (using Anaconda 3)
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Scipy

## Results

Instacart currently has predictable ordering habits with peak purchase periods during the weekends and between midday and mid-afternoon. Instacart's most popular departments are produce, dairy/eggs, snacks, and beverages.  However, meat / seafood represent the highest-priced products. Most Instacart customers have placed less than 10 orders, but "regular" Instacart customers (those with between 10-40 orders) account for the majority of all Instacart orders. Using all of these details, Instacart can consider targeted-marketing campaigns to increase usage during less busy hours, by trying to promote customer retention, and by marketing categories with the highest profits to its regular customers while also marketing the most popular categories to potential new customers.
